# Zeeman_splitting

**Purpose:** This library is a toolkit for making predictions of the weak-field Zeeman shift of spectral lines in an atom. 

**Status:** Presently, this includes only Helium data for a certain set of transitions. Results have agreed with experiments, but testing is not implemented.

**To do:** Extend the library to scrape line data from NIST and populate a larger table, then write it to disk. Produce a small wrapper to query this table and produce values for any transition.
